# An Interactive Psalter

Ancient Hebrew poets (like their polytheistic predecessors) intended
their words to be sung. If you attend a modern Christian or Jewish
worship service, it's very likely you've sung and heard parts of
[psalms set to music](http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/692801/jewish/26-Ashrei-Song.htm). The
prominent feature of Hebrew poetry, parallelism, also assists in
memorization, so many services include recitations where the leader
reads one line or section and the congregation responds with the next
bit. (Our ancestors dedicated more educational resources to the art of
memorization and fewer, if any, to reading.) Finally, the Psalms are
often used in private devotion as prompts for prayer.

This project brings the personal devotion and responsive reading
together via the modern medium of
[interactive fiction](http://www.ifarchive.org/)[^1].


[^1]: Please don't be offended by the word "fiction"; it might be
    easier to just refer to it by the acronym IF.)
