# An Interactive Psalter

Ancient Hebrew poets (like their polytheistic predecessors) intended
their words to be sung. If you attend a modern Christian or Jewish
worship service, it's very likely you've sung and heard parts of
[psalms set to music](http://www.chabad.org/multimedia/media_cdo/aid/692801/jewish/26-Ashrei-Song.htm). The
prominent feature of Hebrew poetry, parallelism, also assists in
memorization, so many services include recitations where the leader
reads one line or section and the congregation responds with the next
bit. (Our ancestors dedicated more educational resources to the art of
memorization and fewer, if any, to reading.) Finally, the Psalms are
often used in private devotion as prompts for prayer.

This project brings the personal devotion and responsive reading
together via the modern medium of
[interactive fiction](http://www.ifarchive.org/). Please don't be
offended by the word "fiction". (It might be easier to just refer to
it by the acronym IF.) Unlike regular poetry collections, the
Interactive Psalter requires the reader to select the next
line. Typically there is only _one_ choice, so the primary effect is
to slow the reader down; force them to contemplate for at least a
moment. Rather than a hardened drainage ditch that funnels words into
the brain, contemplative reading gives words a chance to sink into the
mind.

This project is an attempt to help me think more deeply about the
Psalms. There is
[some evidence](http://blog.digitales.com.au/2014/05/fluency-vs-disfluency-is-there-a-use-for-near-unreadable-fonts/)
that forcing people to slow down helps them think about a text more
deeply. Enforcing a pause (at least long enough for the reader to
click on the next line) certainly gives the reader a chance to
interact with the meanings behind the words she is reading.

## Sources for the text

I have chosen to use the
[1917 edition](https://jps.org/books/holy-scriptures-tanakh-1917-edition/)
of _The Holy Scriptures_ translated and published by the Jewish
Publication Society. While it's not an ideal translation, it possesses
two critical features:

1. I want the project to be as useful to as many people as
   possible. While there are
   [few differences between Christian and Jewish translations](http://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/a/4374/68),
   one of the most divisive
   [appears in the 22<sup>nd</sup> Psalm](http://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/q/105/68). Rather
   than annoy or offend Jewish users, I just picked a translation that
   seems fairly universal. In the future, I might consider adding
   other translations for variety.

2. It is
   [in the public domain](http://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/16377/914). One
   of the nice things is that I can subtly change the text to fit
   better with the medium. Psalm 1:1, for instance, reads:

      The praises of a man are that he did
      not follow the counsel of the wicked,
      neither did he stand in the way of sinners
      nor sit in the company of scorners.

  But I allowed the three follow-on lines to be in any order the reader chooses:

      The praises of a man are that he did
      not sit in the company of scorners,
      not stand in the way of sinners,
      not follow the counsel of the wicked.
      
  The meaning remains the same, but the reader now has another way to
  interact with the text. (When I offer multiple choices like this,
  the canonical reading is to always pick the choices in order.)
